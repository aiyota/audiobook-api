# Audiobook REST API

A REST API to store audiobooks written in express. By not exposing 3rd party dependencies directly, the idea is to avoid tight coupling with those dependencies so that they may be changed easily if needed.

Heavily inspired by Bill Sourour's articles/videos on clean JS design patterns as well as Bob C. Martin's books.
